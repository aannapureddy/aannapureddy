Welcome to my personal site! This is where I'll be sharing thoughts, projects, and whatever else I find interesting.

## About This Site

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator that makes it easy to create simple, fast websites. It's perfect for blogs, portfolios, and documentation sites.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Blog posts** about technology, programming, and other interests
- **Project showcases** of things I'm working on
- **Thoughts and ideas** that I want to share

## Technical Details

This site uses:
- Jekyll for static site generation
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- The Minima theme for styling
- Ruby for the backend processing

## Getting Started

If you want to run this site locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Start the development server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then visit `http://localhost:4000` to see the site.
