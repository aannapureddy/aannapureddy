## About Me

Hi, I'm Arjun Annapureddy (pronounced **aar**·jn - start off strong and sort of just clobber together the end).

This is my personal site where I share my thoughts, projects, and explorations. It's completely separate from my day job - this is what I do for fun.

## What I Do

I'm interested in technology, programming, and building things. This site serves as a place to:

- Share thoughts and ideas
- Document projects I'm working on
- Write about things I'm learning
- Connect with others who share similar interests

## About This Site

This site is built with:
- **Jekyll** - Static site generator
- **GitHub Pages** - Hosting
- **Minima theme** - Clean, minimal design
- **Ruby** - Backend processing

## Contact

- [GitHub](https://github.com/aannapureddy)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/your-profile) (if you want to add this)
